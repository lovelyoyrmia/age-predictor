# Age Predictor Streamlit app

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://share.streamlit.io/lovelyoyrmia/age-predictor/app.py)

All of you can use this a bit code that can help you build age predictor app. First thing first, you have to run the google colab so that you can get models machine learning of age prediction. I'm using deep learning algorithm to predict ages.
